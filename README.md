Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary ## 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

**Search Functionality Limitations**
The new design opened the door for a great deal of opportunity. 

1. limiting search with an inability to search CA instead of ca
2. While individuals could utilize the search function to snag data from a spceific city, state, or date, there could easily be a legend for the shape and some kind of guide to share the date limits
